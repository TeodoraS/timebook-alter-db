# timebook-alter-db

##Description

It has relevance only if you use timebook. The timebook will create a database in home directory and contains 
the sign in time, sign out, and description. 
This application is for personal use, to modify the database, because the time is unixtime and the manual conversion considering local time, takes time. 
It automatically converts the time based on localtime, no matter where.
